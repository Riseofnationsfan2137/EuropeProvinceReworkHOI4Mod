1859_DESC:0 "After the failed revolutions in Italy of 1848, many were discontent with the current political works in Italy, in Sardinia-Piedmont we had a Semi-Consitutional Monarchy, in the South the Borbon Kings were oppresing Civil Rights and killing anyone who dared to disobey, while in the center we had a State Runned by the Pope but protected by France. So in the years of 1859-1866 Camillo Benso di Cavour, Vittorio Emanuele II and Giuseppe Garibaldi all started wars with help from France to unify Italy."
